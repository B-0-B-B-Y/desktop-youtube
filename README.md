# YouTube Desktop

<h3> I wanted to create a beautiful, slick, desktop widget for YouTube, allowing me to enjoy my favourite content whilst working on projects, and have the two workspaces visible side by side right on my desktop. The client comes with ad-blocker built in, and presents you with the full functionality of the web equivalent site. Watch, Comment, Subscribe, Upload and Share content, right from your desktop. </h3> 


# How to setup

1) Open a terminal
2) Navigate to the directory of your choice where you want to clone this project to
3) Run the command *git clone https://github.com/B-0-B-B-Y/desktop-youtube.git*
4) Then run *cd desktop-youtube*
5) Run *ls* and verify that you can see a file called **main.js**
2) Whilst in the same directory where the main.js file is located, please run from terminal *npm install electron --save-dev*
3) Once that's complete, still being in the same directory as main.js, run from terminal *npm start*
