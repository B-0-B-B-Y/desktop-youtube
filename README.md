# YouTube Desktop

<br>
I wanted to create a beautiful, slick, desktop widget for YouTube, allowing me to enjoy my favourite content whilst working on projects, and have the two workspaces visible side by side right on my desktop. The client comes with ad-blocker built in, and presents you with the full functionality of the web equivalent site. Watch, Comment, Subscribe, Upload and Share content, right from your desktop.

# How to install
