# desktop-youtube
A project I built for myself to have youtube run as a desktop app in the corner of my screen, allowing me to watch youtube videos straight from my desktop, running as a widget.


# How to setup

1) Whilst in the same directory where the main.js file is located, please run from terminal *npm install electron --save-dev*
2) Once that's complete, still being in the same directory as main.js, run from terminal *npm start*
