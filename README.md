# desktop-youtube
A project I built for myself to have youtube run as a desktop app in the corner of my screen, allowing me to watch youtube videos straight from my desktop, running as a widget. In this very initial version, I have built it specifically for my screen size and resolution, so it is not yet intended to be used for others, as positioning of elements will be bad and sporadic on other machines.


# How to setup

1) Open a terminal
2) Navigate to the directory of your choice where you want to clone this project to
3) Run the command *git clone -b transparency-issue https://github.com/B-0-B-B-Y/desktop-youtube.git*
4) Then run *cd desktop-youtube*
5) Run *ls* and verify that you can see a file called **main.js**
2) Whilst in the same directory where the main.js file is located, please run from terminal *npm install electron --save-dev*
3) Once that's complete, still being in the same directory as main.js, run from terminal *npm start*
